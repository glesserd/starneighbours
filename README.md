# starneighbours

Find what stargazers of a repo have also starred.



## About the project

The goal is to provide an API that from a GitHub repository provides a list of repositories that are starred by at least one people in common.


## Running

1. Install dependencies using uv.
```sh


```

2. Get a GitHub token.

Follow the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token).
Once done, set it to your env variables:

```sh
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your toekn here"
```


3. Start the server

```sh


```


4. Perform requests

```
GET /repos/<user>/<repo>/starneighbours
```


## Develop

You can start the server in debug mode by setting the `DEBUG` env variable.
It gives access to the swagger documentation in `/docs`.

To test, run `pytest .`.

Every merge requests should satisfy `mypy`, `ruff format` and `ruff lint`.

Architecture:

**Services**

- Services encapsulate the business logic of the application.
- Functions within services follow the naming convention: <entity>_<action>. For example: user_create.
    - The entity can either represent a highly technical component (e.g., S3) or something easily understood by the appâ€™s users.
    - The action is a verb, typically one of: get, list, update, create, or delete.
- A service will manipulate objects declared in models.
- A service can never dependes on a repository. Use the injection dependency framework of fastAPI to declare the necessity to use a repository.


**Repositories**
- Repositories handle communication with external systems such as databases or APIs.
- Public methods only handle basic python types or types declared in models
- Repositories implement classes declared in models.
- A repository cannot depends on a service.


**Models**
- Define the basic data manipulated by the APP
- Declare interfaces that will be used by services and implemented by repositories
- Models can only depends on models.





## Roadmap

- [x] Create a basic README
- [ ] Set-up the structure
- [ ] Create a starneighbour service that depends on a github repository.
    The repository can, from a `github_user` and `github_repo`, get the stargazers of that repo.
    The repository can also from a `github_user`, get the repositories that it has starred.
    The starneighbour service returns the list of neighbours repositories, meaning repositories where at least one stargazer is found in common.
    ```
      [
        {
        "repo": <repoA>,
            "stargazers": [<stargazers in common>, ...],
        },
        {
        "repo": <repo>,
            "stargazers": [<stargazers in common>, ...],
        },
        ...
      ]
    ```
    When writing tests, don't forget to mock the github API.
    Be careful, the github API endpoints might returns error or unexpected data.
    If the githib API returns a `x-ratelimit-reset` header, relay this error and raise an error. Document all of that.
- [ ] Create the `GET /repos/<user>/<repo>/starneighbours` endpoints that uses the starneighbour service.
    Write tests, don't forget to mock GitHub API.
- [ ] Add auth using a bearer token.
    Use an sqlite database, performing SQL request without any ORM.
    Have a `api_tokens` table with `name`, `hashed_token`, `update_at`, `created_at`, `comments`.
    Add to the README a bash on liner to add an hashed token to an existing database.
- [ ] Add the possible next steps to the roadmap.
